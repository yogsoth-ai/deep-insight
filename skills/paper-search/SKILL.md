# Paper Search

AI-powered paper summary and search.

## Execution

Import — strictly follow `literature-engine/literature-search` skill protocol.

## Quality Gate

AI summary level — cite findings as "AI-extracted" not "paper states". For authoritative claims about paper content, use paper-research (full text reading).

## Budget

Quantity target is set by the calling strategy's budget table. This SOP executes one unit = one paper fetch + AI summary generation.

## Import Source

`literature-engine` repo → `skills/literature-search/SKILL.md`
