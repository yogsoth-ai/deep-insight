description: Deep Insight Engine with 5 campaigns (gap-analysis, insight, boundary-analysis, sensitivity-analysis, problem-reformulation). Use this skill whenever a user needs to deeply analyze research gaps, understand root causes, probe method boundaries, assess assumption sensitivity, or reformulate research problems. Pre-condition: north-star-crystallization complete + knowledge-acquisition campaign has produced initial findings.

# Deep Insight

Deep insight engine — from surface phenomena to root causes, boundaries, assumptions, and the problem itself. Five campaigns, each a self-contained autonomous analysis domain. You provide a research gap or finding — the engine routes to the right campaign, selects a strategy, and executes autonomously with quantitative budget enforcement.

## Design Philosophy

兵法书 (Strategy Book) mode. This file is a textbook, not a script. CC reads, internalizes principles, then autonomously constructs the analysis approach for the specific research situation.

Hard constraints only:
- **Budget Gate**: Meet the strategy's quantitative floor (±10%) before completing
- **Minimum Yield**: Per-tactic hard floors on output quality
- **HARD-GATE**: Pre-conditions must be satisfied before entry
- **Context-checkpoint**: Triggered after each strategy completes

Everything else — execution order, iteration count, tactic selection, SOP combination — is CC's autonomous decision.

## Pre-conditions

1. North-star-crystallization must be complete (research intent crystallized)
2. Knowledge-acquisition campaign must have produced initial findings (gaps, patterns, anomalies)

## Four-Level Hierarchy

```
ENTRY.md (this file)
  → Campaign (5): self-contained deep analysis domain
    → Strategy: selected by analysis purpose/intent
      → Tactic: multi-step orchestration pattern (reusable across strategies)
        → SOP: single operation (import or subagent)
```

CC can skip the tactic layer and use SOPs directly when the task is simple enough.

## Campaign Routing

| Signal | Campaign |
|--------|----------|
| gap 识别、空白分类、证据地图、优先级排序、gap 验证 | → gap-analysis |
| 根因分析、利益相关者、张力、HMW、假设审计、5 Whys | → insight |
| 有效性边界、方法失效、鲁棒性、分布偏移、规模极限 | → boundary-analysis |
| 假设排序、敏感性、方差分解、不确定性传播、关键路径 | → sensitivity-analysis |
| 重新定义问题、主导观念、多视角、双环学习、邪恶问题 | → problem-reformulation |

## Multi-Campaign Orchestration

Campaigns can be composed:
- **"深入理解这个 gap"**: gap-analysis → insight
- **"这个方法可靠吗"**: boundary-analysis → sensitivity-analysis
- **"我们是不是在解决错误的问题"**: problem-reformulation (may loop back to gap-analysis)
- **Full deep dive**: gap-analysis → insight → boundary-analysis → sensitivity-analysis → problem-reformulation

The orchestrator decides composition based on the research state and user intent.

## Context Management Integration

- **Campaign start**: context-init (load/create campaign context file)
- **After each strategy completes**: context-checkpoint (append findings to campaign context file)
- **CC discretion**: Additional checkpoints when information density warrants it
- **One context file per campaign**: format `context/deep-insight-[campaign]-[topic].md`
